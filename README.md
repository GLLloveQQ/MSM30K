# MSM30K
```
The MSM30K dataset mainly comes from the two aspects: 
Firstly, seven influential datasets are strictly screened manually, 
which follows the three principles: the images are of high quality, theedited fake images are not easily distinguished, 
the edited image is a real scene in life, and canâ€™t be a non-existent thing in realitye. 

In this paper, in view of the fact that the Ground-truth provided by the some dataset is 
not accurate enough, we invited three laboratory team members to participate in the labeling process. 
Figure 4 shows examples that were passed/rejected. 

The second source of datasets is mainly through two aspects: screening large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, MSCOCO, VOC, 
and crawling life websites. Then the selected images are subjected to delicate tampering operation 
by popular editing software such as Photoshop, AI2020, Movavi Picverse, Photolemur, and Picasa. 

Through the above two collection methods, we have finally produced a dataset of 30000 tampered images of real-life scenes. 
Each tampering type includes 10000 images. It contains a rich set of real-life scenes, including portraits, 
landscape photography, human documentary, photojournalism, commercial photography, ecological photography,
